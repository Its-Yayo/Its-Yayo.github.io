## Basics
I'm Luis De León, or Elyayoveloz :). I'm Mexican and I'm currently studying in Tecnológico de Monterrey Campus Estado de México. I'm studying a Software Engineering (In spanish, Ingeniería en Tecnologías Computacionales or Ingeniería en Software) degree. Also, I'm a junior software engineer and pentester / red team student. These guys are the ones who protect company by attacking it lmao. 

## Why did I start programming?
Back in 2016, I discovered the BASIC language. That one was used as the default language for the Apple II, the VIC-20, the Atari 400 and 800, etc. I tried a BASIC emulator from a Commodore 64 and then, I tried to code something. I remember I did a simple program, like this:
```
10 X = 3
20 Y = 4
30 PRINT X + Y
RUN
```
I know it's a simple code, but it was awesome to see how high-level code is tranlated into machine code. Well, I started to investigate about more programming languages, the history of the computers and computer companies and recently, computing theories. Also, I moved on with some hardware (EPPROMs, RAMs and ROMs memories) and software stuff (Agile Software, Software Life Cycle, Testing). 

## Current Skills 
- Basic Bash Concepts (Shell and Scripting)
- Python (Mainly for exploiting)
- C/C++ (Mainly for vulnerabilities) 
- JavaScript (Mainly for server deploys for testing)
- Backend Development
- Async Programming
- Basic Clouding concepts (IaaS, SaaS, PaaS)
- Networking concepts (OSI Model, Topology's Networks...)

## Current Goals
- To learn Rust, Go and Perl as my mainly languages to exploit vulnerabiltiies
- To be certified in any of these (CEH, OSCP, OSCE (this one after OSCP), eJPT, eWPT, eCCPTv2 and LPT) for now. 
- To increase my record list in the [CVE](https://cve.org/) (Common vulnerabilities and Exposures). 
- To learn more about malwares and which vulnerabilities they use. 
- To work as a pentester for fun :)

## Current Topics
- Networking Concepts (IPv4, IPv6, Subnetting...)
- Recognisance (Nmap scanning, local ARP and ICMP nets, fuzzing, files enumeration...)
- Docker Deployment (Port forwarding, Docker containers...)
- Service Enumeration (FTP, HTTP, HTTPS, SMB, WordExpress...)
- Exploitation (Reverse, bind and forward shells, payloads, BurpSuite...)
- OWASP and Web Vulnerabilities (SQL, XXE, SSTI, CSTI, LDAP, NoSQL and LaTeX injections...) 
- Privilage Escalation (Kernel exploitation, Docker breakout...)
- Buffer Overflows (EIP Registers, Shellcode...)
- Forward and Reverse Engineering (IDA Pro, Ghindra...)
- Social Engineering (SET...)
- Pivoting (Proxychains, SSH Tunnels...)
- Extra Tools (Metasploit, SQLMap)

## Current Lab for Productivity
Currently, I have an iPad 9th Gen (2021) running iPadOS 16 set up with Code App, a text editor for programming for iOS and iPadOS. It also works as a virtual notebook (not only mine). Also I have an Asus VivoBook 14 running 2 OS locally. Just I can switch with the one I wanna use in the GNU Grub bootloader. It has a freshly Windows 11 22H2 and Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. Both OS share a local 500 GB SSD disk where I store all my important projects, docs, etc. For coding, I use VSCode as the "emergency IDE" but for every language, I have my own IDE from [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/) (CLion, Pycharm, Rider, WebStorm, IntelliJ Idea). Each OS has it's own partition from another 1 TB SSD disk to store local programs and to optimize my workstation space. For testing, I use VMware 17 Workstation/Player and currently, I have 6 Virtual Machines (3 of 'em for my course)
- Kali 2023.1 
- Windows 10 2019 Lite Version
- Windows 7 Ultimate 
- Windows XP Home Professional 
- Arch Linux (Not mounted yet)
- Ubuntu 23.04 

Also, I have my iPhone 7 Plus and my Nothing Ear (Stick), as well as my Xiaomi Smart Band 7. I'm earning for some hardware hacking tools like a HakCat Wifi Nugget or the Flipper Zero :)

## Hobbies
I'm a geek guy, usually I like normal but sometimes weird stuff lol. Let's list a few of 'em:
- I like riced OS distributions, I used to have mine one with Arch. Check out the [r/unixporn](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/) Reddit community. 
- I like bowling, my current style to play is the 2-handed one.
- I like Chess, I used to have +1400 but after 2-3 years without playing, my ratio went down to +800. 
- I like drawing and taking pics of cute landscapes and showing 'em to special people.
- Besides programming and computing, my other passions are also space, military infraestructure, aviation and motorsport.
- Recently I started to listen piano and reflective music for work.
- My fav genre of all time is metal music. Some good bands are: Iron Maiden, Metallica, Overkill, Exodus, Kiss, Y&T, Stratovarius, Helloween, DRI, Municipal Waste, Skull Fist, Enforcer...
- But also, I like synthwave retro (VHS Dreams, Waveshaper), phonk music (Kordhell, Dxrk ダーク), 80s and current pop spanish music (Soda Stereo, Juanes, Sin Bandera), electronic music (Daft Punk, Martin Garrix)
- I like Star Wars. My fav movie is the 5th episode (2nd cronology talking). The Empire Strikes Back is a masterpiece. However, my fav movie is Interstellar
- I like to challenge myself with new challenges. (To assemble a new lego, to try a new coding problem with a new algorithm, test out my math skills...)

## Notes
Usually, I'm a hard-disciplined guy who learnt a lot in his past. I've learnt so many lessons in life I'd like to share to other young people to success in life as they grow to. So many few special people taught me how's life working inside a person, and that stuff. Also, the biggest things come in the moment you were not expecting for. Actually, you don't know where and when it's gonna happen, but they do. I've recieved some special cute things from those few people, worrying and taking care of me sometimes. Who reads this text, will identify who I'm talking to. Just I wanna say thank you yall from the bottom of my heart. :)

## Favorite Quotes
- "That dream that you've holding in your mind, it's possible"
- "When people say you can't do it, those people is showing you their limits, not yours"
- "It's very important for you to believe that you are the one"
- "The lifehack of life is not seeing what didn't happen, but seeing what you did to make up for it"
- "If motivation dies, the discipline will resurrect it"

Happy coding :)
