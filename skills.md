## Current Skills 
- Basic Bash Concepts (Shell and Scripting)
- Intermediate Python (Mainly for exploiting)
- Intermediate C/C++ (Mainly for vulnerabilities) 
- Intermediate JavaScript (Mainly for server deploys for testing)
- Backend Development
- Basic Async Programming
- Basic Clouding concepts (IaaS, SaaS, PaaS)
- Networking concepts (OSI Model, Topology's Networks...)

## Current Goals
- To learn Rust, Go and Perl as my mainly languages to exploit vulnerabiltiies
- To be certified in any of these (CEH, OSCP, OSCE (this one after OSCP), eJPT, eWPT, eCCPTv2 and LPT) for now. 
- To increase my record list in the [CVE](https://cve.org/) (Common vulnerabilities and Exposures). 
- To learn more about malwares and which vulnerabilities they use. 
- To work as a pentester for fun :)

## Current Topics
- Networking Concepts (IPv4, IPv6, Subnetting...)
- Recognisance (Nmap scanning, local ARP and ICMP nets, fuzzing, files enumeration...)
- Docker Deployment (Port forwarding, Docker containers...)
- Service Enumeration (FTP, HTTP, HTTPS, SMB, WordExpress...)
- Exploitation (Reverse, bind and forward shells, payloads, BurpSuite...)
- OWASP and Web Vulnerabilities (SQL, XXE, SSTI, CSTI, LDAP, NoSQL and LaTeX injections...) 
- Privilage Escalation (Kernel exploitation, Docker breakout...)
- Buffer Overflows (EIP Registers, Shellcode...)
- Forward and Reverse Engineering (IDA Pro, Ghindra...)
- Social Engineering (SET...)
- Pivoting (Proxychains, SSH Tunnels...)
- Extra Tools (Metasploit, SQLMap)

## Current Lab for Productivity
I have an Asus VivoBook 14 running 2 OS locally. Just I can switch with the one I wanna use in the GNU Grub bootloader. It has a freshly Windows 11 23H2 and Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. Both OS share a local  disk where I store all my important projects, docs, etc. For coding, I use VSCode as the "emergency IDE" but for every language, I have my own IDE from [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/) (CLion, PyCharm, Rider, WebStorm, IntelliJ Idea). Each OS has it's own partition from another disk to store local programs and to optimize my workstation space. For testing, I use VMware Workstation/Player and currently, I have 5 Virtual Machines (3 of 'em for my course)
- Kali 2023.1 
- Windows 10 2019 Lite Version
- Windows XP Home Professional 
- Arch Linux (Not mounted yet)
- Ubuntu 23.04 

Peace coding fellas :)
