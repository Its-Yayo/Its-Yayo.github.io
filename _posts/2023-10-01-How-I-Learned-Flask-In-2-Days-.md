## Intro
I had to make a web app for a complete architecture project. This includes 2 mobile apps made with Kotlin, a fully-functional dynamic web app and an RDS DB instance. My team's doing both mobile apps (Yea, I'm not an Android dev lmao), so I focused on making this website. I'll say one of the members of my team helped me with the client-side code. (Yea, also the ```XMLHttpRequest();``` stuff). I was focused more in the server-side code, since I have more experience with it. 

In April 2023, I learnt Express.js, a backend framework to build minimal APIs for Node and JavaScript. I wasn't comfortable with it a lot (and not because my professor wasn't teach it well. In fact, he is one of the best programming teachers I've ever had) because JavaScript is not a language I really love. It's good for basic stuff and for beginners but I'ma say I'd rather use Python or Rust (soooooon). Also, I find the fact that I cannot learn so quite a bit at the time I'm surrounded with my fellow extroverts haha. I need some space to learn, to capture more knowledge to my fully-prepared brain. I discarted Express.js for htis project for time reasons but also I needed to build something with passion and discipline. 

My professor suggested me Flask as a good option framework with Python. I didn't know how th I'd implement Flask in the whole app. I started resourcing by myself in a week we call "Semana Tec", which is like an week-off once we finish a period (A semester has 3 periods). 

Before starting this journey, I'll say that previously I had some knowledge about HTTP methods, status codes and basic APIs development since my experience with Express.js. But, as I said before, I didn't learne quite a bit so I checked it again by my own before starting out. 

Yea, that's when I proposed myself I can learn a whole framework within 2 days. For that, I needed to find a good idea for a project that may allow me to learn Flask. Then, back in Sep 11 2023, I decided to make F-test.

## F-test
Originally, F-test was a BMI calculator. A basic web app and super boring lmao. I improved it by setting up a new goal: A single app that sends, edits and deletes data from a single HTTP layout. Where is this data stored? Yea, good question. Remember I said something about an RDS DB instance? Yea, well... I used MariaDB as the DBMS since I had experience with MySQL back in the day. Also. I used SQL Server someday but I didn't like it lol.
