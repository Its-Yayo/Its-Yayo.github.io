## Current Skills 
- Basic Bash Concepts (Shell and Scripting)
- Intermediate Python (Mainly for exploiting)
- Intermediate C/C++ (Mainly for vulnerabilities) 
- Intermediate JavaScript (Mainly for server deploys for testing)
- Backend Development
- Basic Async Programming
- Basic Clouding concepts (IaaS, SaaS, PaaS)
- Networking concepts (OSI Model, Topology's Networks...)

## Current Goals
- To learn Rust, Go and Perl as my mainly languages to exploit vulnerabiltiies
- To be certified in any of these (CEH, OSCP, OSCE (this one after OSCP), eJPT, eWPT, eCCPTv2 and LPT) for now. 
- To increase my record list in the [CVE](https://cve.org/) (Common vulnerabilities and Exposures). 
- To learn more about malwares and which vulnerabilities they use. 
- To work as a pentester for fun :)

## My Lab
I use Debian GNU/Linux 12 as my proper primarly OS and probably I'll use it foverver. I used to have Windows 10 and 11 but not anymore. I store my VMs with QEMU/KVM, I play some videogames on steam and local .deb packages, I code and develop programs and packages as well (and still learning), I do my researches as well and I use it as whatever I want. The single reason why I chose Debian is because one single true purpose and it is because of the love to true software and researches over money and commercial lack-of-purpose software. Also because I like control and privacy. Yea, I have to setup things in my ```/etc/apt/sources.list``` file but I mean, that's because I want to. I feel that's a true energy from my deep purpose/eternity path.  

Peace coding fellas :)
