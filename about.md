## Basics
I'm Luis De León, or Elyayoveloz :). I'm Mexican. I'm studying a Software Engineering (In spanish, Ingeniería en Tecnologías Computacionales or Ingeniería en Software) degree. Also, I'm a junior software engineer and pentester / red team student. These guys are the ones who protect a company by attacking it lmao. Also, I'm a DevOps and DevSecOps enthusiastic.

## Why did I start programming?
I discovered the BASIC language. That one was used as the default language for the Apple II, the VIC-20, the Atari 400 and 800, etc. I tried a BASIC emulator from a Commodore 64 and then, I tried to code something. I remember I did a simple program, like this:
```
10 X = 3
20 Y = 4
30 PRINT X + Y
RUN
```
I know it's a simple code, but it was awesome to see how high-level code is translated into machine code. Well, I started to investigate about more programming languages, the history of the computers and computer companies and recently, computing theories. Also, I moved on with some hardware (EPPROMs, RAMs and ROMs memories) and software stuff (Agile Software, Software Life Cycle, Testing). 


## Hobbies
- I like (and started) to do researches and discoveries about the mind (neurology and pychoneuroimmunology) to modify it in a positive way on the trascendence of the human being (eternity) and to revert the well-said human deterioration
- I like riced OS distributions. Check out the [r/unixporn](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/) Reddit community. 
- I like bowling, my current style to play is the 2-handed one, my highest score for now is 219, 165.2 avg
- I like to play chess, I'm improving my ratio :)
- I like drawing and taking pics of cute landscapes and showing 'em to special people.
- Besides programming and computing, my other passions are also space, military infraestructure, aviation and motorsport.
- Recently I started to listen piano and reflective music for work.
- My first fav music genre of all time is phonk, it helps me a lot with motivation, discipline, coding, to be myself and **to build my purpose/eternity**. Some good artists I like are: INTERWORLD, Kordhell, Dxrk ダーク, phonk.me, Isolate.exe, glichery, MoonDeity, DVRST, Mareux, etc... 
- My second fav music gente of all time is metal. It helps me to remind myself why I'm different. Some good bands are: Dragonforce, Iron Maiden, Metallica, Overkill, Exodus, Kiss, Y&T, Stratovarius, Helloween, DRI, Municipal Waste, Skull Fist, Enforcer, etc...
- But also, I like synthwave retro (VHS Dreams, Waveshaper), retro and pop spanish music (Soda Stereo, Juanes), electronic music (Daft Punk, Martin Garrix)
- I like Star Wars. However, my fav movie is Interstellar
- I like to challenge myself with new challenges. (To assemble a new lego, to try a new coding problem with a new algorithm, test out my math skills...)

## Favorite Quotes
- "Talk is cheap. Show me the code"
- "That dream that you've holding in your mind, it's real"
- "When people say you can't do it, those people is showing you their limits, not yours"
- "It's very important for you to believe that you are the one"
- "The lifehack of a growing life is not seeing what didn't happen, but seeing what you did to make up for it"
- "If motivation fails, the discipline will help it to grow"

Peace coding fellas :)
