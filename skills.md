## My Lab

I use OpenSUSE Tumbleweed as my proper OSs to work and probably I'll use them forever. I store my VMs with QEMU/KVM, I play some videogames on steam and local packages and flatpak packages, I code and develop programs and packages as well (and still learning), I do my researches as well and I use it as whatever I want. The single reason why I chose OpenSUSE is because one single true purpose and it is because of the a merged between Debian (love to true software, stability and researches over money and commercial lack-of-purpose software) and Arch (Do-it-yourself approach where I can learn a lot).
Both distros are my favs of all time, but now OpenSUSE is now added to the list :)
Also because I like control and privacy.
