## Basics
I'm Luis De León, or Elyayoveloz :). I'm Mexican. I'm studying a Software Engineering (In spanish, Ingeniería en Tecnologías Computacionales or Ingeniería en Software) degree. Also, I'm a junior software engineer and pentester / red team student. These guys are the ones who protect a company by attacking it lmao. Also, I'm a DevOps and DevSecOps enthusiastic.

## Why did I start programming?
I discovered the BASIC language. That one was used as the default language for the Apple II, the VIC-20, the Atari 400 and 800, etc. I tried a BASIC emulator from a Commodore 64 and then, I tried to code something. I remember I did a simple program, like this:
```
10 X = 3
20 Y = 4
30 PRINT X + Y
RUN
```
I know it's a simple code, but it was awesome to see how high-level code is translated into machine code. Well, I started to investigate about more programming languages, the history of the computers and computer companies and recently, computing theories. Also, I moved on with some hardware (EPPROMs, RAMs and ROMs memories) and software stuff (Agile Software, Software Life Cycle, Testing). 


## Hobbies
I'm a geek and grown man guy. Let's list a few of 'em:
- I like to do researches about the brain and the mind to modify it in a positive way on the trascendence of the human being (eternity)
- I like riced OS distributions. Check out the [r/unixporn](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/) Reddit community. 
- I like bowling, my current style to play is the 2-handed one.
- I like Chess, I used to have +1400 but after 2-3 years without playing, my ratio went down to +800. 
- I like drawing and taking pics of cute landscapes and showing 'em to special people.
- Besides programming and computing, my other passions are also space, military infraestructure, aviation and motorsport.
- Recently I started to listen piano and reflective music for work.
- MY fav genre of all time is phonk, it helps me a lot with motivation, discipline, coding, to be myself and **to build my purpose/eternity**. Some good artists are: INTERWORLD, Kordhell, Dxrk ダーク, phonk.me, Isolate.exe, glichery, MoonDeity, DVRST, Mareux, etc... 
- Also I love metal music. Some good bands are: Iron Maiden, Metallica, Overkill, Exodus, Kiss, Y&T, Stratovarius, Helloween, DRI, Municipal Waste, Skull Fist, Enforcer, etc...
- But also, I like synthwave retro (VHS Dreams, Waveshaper), 80s and current pop spanish music (Soda Stereo, Juanes, Sin Bandera), electronic music (Daft Punk, Martin Garrix)
- I like Star Wars. However, my fav movie is Interstellar
- I like to challenge myself with new challenges. (To assemble a new lego, to try a new coding problem with a new algorithm, test out my math skills...)

## Notes
Usually, I'm a hard-disciplined guy who learnt a lot in his past. I've learnt so many lessons in life I'd like to share to other young people to success in life as they grow to. So many few special people taught me how's life working inside a person, and that stuff. Also, the biggest things come in the moment you were not expecting for. Actually, you don't know where and when it's gonna happen, but they do. I've recieved some special cute things from those few people, worrying and taking care of me sometimes. Who reads this text, will identify who I'm talking to. Just I wanna say thank you yall from the bottom of my heart. :)

## Favorite Quotes
- "Talk is cheap. Show me the code"
- "That dream that you've holding in your mind, it's real"
- "When people say you can't do it, those people is showing you their limits, not yours"
- "It's very important for you to believe that you are the one"
- "The lifehack of a growing life is not seeing what didn't happen, but seeing what you did to make up for it"
- "If motivation fails, the discipline will help it to grow"

Peace coding fellas :)
