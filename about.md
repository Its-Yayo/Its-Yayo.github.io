## Basics
Btw, this was [my first](https://y4yorc.github.io/) site page and now it is archived so u can check it out haha, now it's totally different and with my energy towards myself and my surroundings. 

I'm Yayo (or Yayitz). I'm a junior software developer and a computer science's student. Also, I'm a DevOps and DevSecOps enthusiastic. I like to build software, apps, etc. Also I love researching about the mind, how it works and how to control it. 


## Hobbies
- I like (and started) to do researches and discoveries about the mind (neurology and pychoneuroimmunology) to modify it in a positive way on the trascendence of the human being (eternity) and to revert the well-said human deterioration. Also to know how to control my mind and my thoughts and actions.
- I like riced OS distributions. This is my [riced Ubuntu](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/1g9lc7s/openbox_i_use_ubuntu_btw/) lol
- I like bowling and chess
- I like to listen to piano and reflective music for work.
- My first fav music genre of all time is phonk, it helps me a lot with motivation, discipline, coding, to be myself and **to build my purpose/eternity**. 
- My second fav music genre of all time is metal. It helps me to remind myself why I'm different. 
- I like to challenge myself with new challenges

## Favorite Quotes
- "And the end of the day, it's you and you. or, have you ever seen a group of eagles going for the same target?"
- "Talk is cheap. Show me the code"
- "That dream that you've holding in your mind, it's real"
- "When people say you can't do it, those people is showing you their limits, not yours"
- "It's very important for you to believe that you are the one"
- "The lifehack of a growing life is not seeing what didn't happen, but seeing what you did to make up for it"

Peace coding fellas :)
