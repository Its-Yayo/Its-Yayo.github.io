## Basics
I'm Luis De León, or Elyayoveloz :). I'm Mexican and I'm currently studying in Tecnológico de Monterrey Campus Estado de México. I'm studying a Software Engineering (In spanish, Ingeniería en Tecnologías Computacionales). It's mainly a major, but I'm studying by my own some programming and hacking stuff, especially pentesting and red teaming (the guys who attacks and pwns the system lol) 

## Why did I start programming?
Back in 2016, I discovered the BASIC language. That one was used as the default language for the Apple II, the VIC-20, the Atari 400 and 800, etc. I tried a BASIC emulator from a Commodore 64 and then, I tried to code something. I remember I did a simple program, like this:
```
10 X = 3
20 Y = 4
30 PRINT X + Y
RUN
```
I know it's a simple code, but man, I falled in love with anything related with computers after that. Well, I started to investigate about more programming languages, the history of the computers and computer companies and recently, computing theories. Also, I moved on with some hardware (EPPROMs, RAMs and ROMs memories) and software stuff (Agile Software, Software Life Cycle, Testing). 

## Current Skills 
- Basic Bash Concepts (Shell and Scripting)
- Python (Mainly for exploiting)
- C/C++ (Mainly for vulnerabities) 
- JavaScript (Mainly for server deploys for testing)
- Backend Development
- Async Programming
- Basic Clouding concepts (IaaS, SaaS, PaaS)
- Networking concepts (OSI Model, Topology's Networks...)

## Current Goals
- To learn Rust, Go and Perl as my mainly languages to exploit vulnerabilies
- To be certified in any of these (CEH, OSCP, OSCE (this one after OSCP), eJPT, eWPT, eCCPTv2 and LPT) for now. 
- To increase my record list in the CVE (Common vulnerabilies and Exposures). Recently, I was checking CVE-2017-0144. 
- To learn more about malwares and which vulnerabilities they use. 
- To work as a pentester for fun :)

## Current topics
- Networking Concepts (IPv4, IPv6, Subnetting...)
- Recognisance (Nmap scanning, local ARP and ICMP nets, fuzzing, files enumeration...)
- Docker Deployment (Port forwarding, Docker containers...)
- Service Enumeration (FTP, HTTP, HTTPS, SMB, WordExpress...)
- Exploitation (Reverse, bind and forward shells, payloads, BurpSuite...)
- OWASP and Web Vulnerabilities (SQL, XXE, SSTI, CSTI, LDAP, NoSQL and LaTeX injections...) 
- Privilage Escalation (Kernel exploitation, Docker breakout...)
- Buffer Overflows (EIP Registers, Shellcode...)
- Forward and Reverse Engineering (IDA Pro, Ghindra...)
- Social Engineering (SET...)
- Pivoting (Proxychains, SSH Tunnels...)
- Extra Tools (Metasploit, SQLMap)

## Current Lab
Currently, I have an iPad 9th Gen (2021) running iPadOS 16 set up with Code App, a text editor for programming for iOS and iPadOS. Also I have an Asus VivoBook 14 X421FAY_X413FA running 2 OS locally. Just I can switch with the one I wanna use in the GNU Grub bootloader. It has a freshly Windows 11 22H2 and Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. Both OS share a local 500 GB SSD disk where I store all my important projects, docs, etc. Each OS has it's own partition from another 1 TB SSD disk to store local programs and to optimize my workstation space. For testing, I use VMWare 17 Workstation/Player and currently, I have 6 Virtual Machines (3 of 'em for my course)
- Kali 2023.1 
- Windows 10 2019 Lite Version
- Windows 7 Ultimate 
- Windows XP Home Professional 
- Arch Linux (Not mounted yet)
- Ubuntu 23.04
