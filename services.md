## Coding Classes (Basic - Intermediate)

On [contact](https://its-yayo.github.io/contact) you can check my timing stuff and you can [mail](mailto:elyayoveloz@gmail.com) me (or dm me on [X](https://twitter.com/Elyayoveloz) for any doubt you have, so we schedule a live 30 to 40-min meeting on Google Meet or Discord (Your choice). The topics we can encompass in pseudocode (or Python or single notes) are:
- Basic concepts (What's programming, introduction to programming languages, syntax's).
- Variables.
- Datatypes and Data Structures
- Operators
- Basic Algorithms 
- If Statements (If, if-else, else).
- Loop Statements (For, while, while-do).
- OOP (Classes, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, encapsulation).
- Exception Throws
- Basic low-level stuff (Memory allocation, pointers).
- Basic backend development concepts (HTTP methods, APIs, DBs, communication architectures). 
- Git (Version control system) and Github setup

Classes are only given in english and spanish. The cost of it will depend of the class's length and the difficulty of the doubt. Cost will round between $3 to $7 USD ($60 to $120 MXN) per class (meeting). I'll give yall fully details of my bank account. **For security reasons (in other words, for a scam protection lmao), you will need to pay me an advance of $3 USD ($60 MXN) before starting the class (meeting)**.  

In case you are interested, **you need to schedule me with a 24h anticipation to prepare myself with a short presentation/notes.** 


## Notes
I also have a side contract job, so in case you text me and I'm not available in the morning-afternoon, it's because I'm either working or building myself/my mind in the gym :). I'll check if there's any appointments/messages in the evening. In case I offer another service by myself, I'll point it out here.  

Peace coding fellas :)
