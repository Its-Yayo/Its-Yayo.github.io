## Current Skills 
- Basic Bash Concepts (Shell and Scripting)
- Intermediate Python (Mainly for exploiting)
- Intermediate C/C++ (Mainly for vulnerabilities) 
- Intermediate JavaScript (Mainly for server deploys for testing)
- Backend Development
- Basic Async Programming
- Basic Clouding concepts (IaaS, SaaS, PaaS)
- Networking concepts (OSI Model, Topology's Networks...)

## Current Goals
- To learn Rust, Go and Perl as my mainly languages to exploit vulnerabiltiies
- To be certified in any of these (CEH, OSCP, OSCE (this one after OSCP), eJPT, eWPT, eCCPTv2 and LPT) for now. 
- To increase my record list in the [CVE](https://cve.org/) (Common vulnerabilities and Exposures). 
- To learn more about malwares and which vulnerabilities they use. 
- To work as a pentester for fun :)

- Docker Deployment (Port forwarding, Docker containers...)
- Service Enumeration (FTP, HTTP, HTTPS, SMB, WordExpress...)
- Exploitation (Reverse, bind and forward shells, payloads, BurpSuite...)
- OSINT skills
- OWASP and Web Vulnerabilities (SQL, XXE, SSTI, CSTI, LDAP, NoSQL and LaTeX injections...) 
- Privilage Escalation (Kernel exploitation, Docker breakout...)
- Buffer Overflows (EIP Registers, Shellcode...)
- Forward and Reverse Engineering (IDA Pro, Ghindra...)
- Social Engineering (SET...)

## Current Lab for Productivity
I have my Asus VivoBook 14 running 2 OS locally. Just I can switch with the one I wanna use in the GNU Grub bootloader. I use Linux 100%, so I have a 700 GB partition for a customized Linux Mint 21.3 Virginia (for now) and I use it for Windows apps (with Wine), some games, general development, container deployments, virtual machines and basically the stuff I used to do when I had Windows. Also I have a 300 GB partition for a fully customized Ubuntu 22.04 LTS with rofi, openbox and tint2. I basically deleted the GNOME default desktop haha. I use it for virtual machines as well (with QEMU/KVM), some terminal hints, some music with Spotify (GUI and CLI) and development. I use both OS' to take notes about myself and to play chess. 

Peace coding fellas :)
